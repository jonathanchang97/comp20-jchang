## lab8 README
1) What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
*   The purpose of this Git repository is to have a safe working environment for the assignments and labs of the Tufts comp20 class.  The repository is useful for version control and keeping track of changes

2) What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
*   My favorite lab was the responsive lab.  I think it's so important to remember responsive design.  With the way web viewing is so different from device to device, it's important to design for all types of experiences.  I've personally come across sites where this is not the case and it can really take away from an otherwise great site.

3) How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
*   I think I've grown substantially from day 1 of this course.  I came into this course with solid web programming experience, but that was without understanding the reason things were created the way they were created.  I had little knowledge of HTTP and understanding how the web is built.  I now feel like i have my foundation.

4) What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
*   a. Understanding HTTP requests was a huge step in my learning and actually understanding how the web was built and what exactly is happening when you click things on the web.
*   b. Understanding the role of the server and not just take a server for granted.  a3 made me appreciate that greatly.

5) Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
*   I am going to continue to delve deeper into my understanding of web frameworks.  I am working with Django on my final project and it's amazing how web frameworks can pull together all the pieces we learned during the semester to create a large-scale project.
